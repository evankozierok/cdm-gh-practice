cavemen could only communicate through word of mouth

then people could communicate with paper and ink which led to the invention of the Gutenberg press

Soon came the advent of typewriters, the precursors to today's keyboards

and then computers, where everything changed...

Their numerical ways allowed for `algorithms` to automate media, letting humans sit back and relax
